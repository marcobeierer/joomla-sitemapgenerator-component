COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_CONFIGURATION="Sitemap Generator: Configuration"

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_CONFIG_DESC="The Sitemap Generator service allows you to create a sitemap with up to 500 URLs for free. If your website has more URLs or you like to integrate an image and video sitemap, you can buy a token for the <a href="https://www.marcobeierer.com/joomla-extensions/sitemap-generator-professional">Sitemap Generator Professional</a> to create a sitemap with up to 50000 URLs."
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_CONFIG_LABEL="General"

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_TOKEN_LABEL="Token"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_TOKEN_DESC="Your token for the Sitemap Generator."

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_CA_FALLBACK_LABEL="Certificate Authority Fallback"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_CA_FALLBACK_DESC="If activated, the necessary Certificate Authority certificates are loaded from a local file instead of the systems default path. This could solve some SSL verification issues if the systems default file is outdated. However, it should only be activated if really necessary, because it could make the Sitemap Generator fail in the future if not always updated to the latest version."

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_MULTILANG_SUPPORT_LABEL="Multilanguage Support (experimental)"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_MULTILANG_SUPPORT_DESC="If you have a multilanguage site and have SEF urls activated, you can active this option to create one sitemap for each language version of your site. Please note that this feature is currently experimental."

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_IGNORE_EMBEDDED_CONTENT_LABEL="Ignore Embedded Content"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_IGNORE_EMBEDDED_CONTENT_DESC="Do not add embedded content, like for example images, to the sitemap. This option is only useful if you are using a valid token. Without a token, embedded content is never added to the sitemap."

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_MAX_FETCHERS_LABEL="Concurrent Connections"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_MAX_FETCHERS_DESC="Number of the maximal concurrent connections. The default value is three concurrent connections, but some hosters do not allow three concurrent connections or an installed extension may use that much resources on each request that the limitations of your hosting is reached with three concurrent connections. With this option you can limit the number of concurrent connections used to access your website and make the Sitemap Generator work under these circumstances. You can also increase the number of concurrent connections if your server can handle it."

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_REFERENCE_COUNT_THRESHOLD_LABEL="Reference Count Threshold"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_REFERENCE_COUNT_THRESHOLD_DESC="<p>With the reference count threshold you can define that images and videos that are embedded on more than the selected number of HTML pages are excluded from the sitemap.</p>
<p>This option is for example useful if you have an image in the header or footer of your website that you do not like to include in the sitemap.</p>
<p>If no threshold is selected, all images and videos are included in the sitemap, even if they are embedded on all HTML pages. If you set the threshold to 0, no images and videos are included in the sitemap. A value of for example 5 means that all images and videos that are embedded on more than 5 HTM
L pages are excluded from the sitemap. However, if the excluded image or video is also embedded on the frontpage, it is assigned to the frontpage and included once in the sitemap. Images that are linked (not embedded) are always added to the sitemap, independent of this option.</p>
<p>The selected value does not affect the URL limit because the images and videos have to be crawled even if they get excluded finally.</p>"

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_QUERY_PARAMS_TO_REMOVE_LABEL="Query Params To Remove"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_QUERY_PARAMS_TO_REMOVE_DESC="<p>An ampersend (&amp;) separated list of query parameters that are removed from each URL before the URL is processed. This could be useful if you have for example timestamps in your URLs.</p>
<p>If you like to remove the query parameters <em>q</em> and <em>timestamp</em> from all URLs, a valid value would for example be:</p>
<pre>q&amp;timestamp</pre>"

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_DISABLE_COOKIES_LABEL="Disable Cookies"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_DISABLE_COOKIES_DESC="<p>The Sitemap Generator crawler has cookie support enabled by default. Thus the cookies that are set by your website are used for all subsequent requests. After each run, all cookies get deleted.</p>
<p>Normally you like to have cookie support enabled because human visitors usually have cookies enabled and with cookie support, the Sitemap Generator can behave like a human visitor. However, if you have reasons to disable cookie support, you do it with this option.</p>"
