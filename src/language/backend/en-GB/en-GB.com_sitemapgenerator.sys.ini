COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_CONFIGURATION="Sitemap Generator: Configuration"

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_CONFIG_DESC="The Sitemap Generator service allows you to create a sitemap with up to 500 URLs for free. If your website has more URLs or you like to integrate an image and video sitemap, you can buy a token for the <a href="https://www.marcobeierer.com/joomla-extensions/sitemap-generator-professional">Sitemap Generator Professional</a> to create a sitemap with up to 50000 URLs."
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_CONFIG_LABEL="General"

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_TOKEN_LABEL="Token"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_TOKEN_DESC="Your token for the Sitemap Generator."

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_CA_FALLBACK_LABEL="Certificate Authority Fallback"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_CA_FALLBACK_DESC="If activated, the necessary Certificate Authority certificates are loaded from a local file instead of the systems default path. This could solve some SSL verification issues if the systems default file is outdated. However, it should only be activated if really necessary, because it could make the Sitemap Generator fail in the future if not always updated to the latest version."

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_MULTILANG_SUPPORT_LABEL="Multilanguage Support (experimental)"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_MULTILANG_SUPPORT_DESC="If you have a multilanguage site and have SEF urls activated, you can active this option to create one sitemap for each language version of your site. Please note that this feature is currently experimental."

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_IGNORE_EMBEDDED_CONTENT_LABEL="Ignore Embedded Content"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_IGNORE_EMBEDDED_CONTENT_DESC="Do not add embedded content, like for example images, to the sitemap. This option is only useful if you are using a valid token. Without a token, embedded content is never added to the sitemap."

COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_MAX_FETCHERS_LABEL="Concurrent Connections"
COM_SITEMAPGENERATOR_FIELD_MAX_FETCHERS_DESC="Number of the maximal concurrent connections. The default value is three concurrent connections, but some hosters do not allow three concurrent connections or an installed extension may use that much resources on each request that the limitations of your hosting is reached with three concurrent connections. With this option you can limit the number of concurrent connections used to access your website and make the Sitemap Generator work under these circumstances. You can also increase the number of concurrent connections if your server can handle it."
