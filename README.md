# Sitemap Generator

## TODO refactoring
- // rename param proxy-u-r-l
- // controller/proxy
	- // get params from request
		- // maybe take whole request and attach to query?
- // message that sitemap was saved and no download is required...
	- // maybe view link instead of download?

- test if query params to remove works with filtering...
	- is urlencode automatically applied?
- test multilang support

- use real release, not latest

## TODO
- add tabs for multi lang sites similar to link checker
- add support for splitted sitemaps

- Remove multilingual support option
	- Could be automatically determined if necessary
